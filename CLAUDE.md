## Project: `skate`

### Purpose

Terminal app for live ice skating race tracking. Operator inputs lap splits as they happen; the app predicts finish times and tracks inter-skater gaps.

### Structure

```sh
skate/
├── race_predictor.py       # Entry point — run this
├── start.py                # Shortcut launcher
├── demo.py                 # Demo with fake data
├── models/
│   ├── skater.py           # Skater state + speed-based prediction
│   ├── race.py             # Race state management
│   ├── competition.py      # Competition + leaderboard
│   ├── person.py           # Skater profile entity
│   └── race_preset.py      # Distance configs (1500m, 3000m, 5000m, 10000m)
├── engine/

├── ui/

│   └── base_ui.py          # Base display components
├── presets/                # JSON race distance configs
├── data/
│   ├── competitions/       # Competition fixture JSON files
│   └── people/             # Individual skater profiles (JSON)
├── scripts/
│   ├── parse_pdf.py        # Extract skater lists from PDF start lists
│   ├── manage_persons.py   # CRUD for skater database
│   └── populate_people_from_competition.py
└── tests/
    └── test_race_predictor.py  # Unit tests
```

### State

Complete and functional. All core features work. Skater profiles include historical PB/SB data. PDF parsing script exists for loading real competition start lists.

### Key design decisions

- Predictions use average speed (m/s) rather than raw lap times, which handles variable-distance first laps correctly.
- Time input is flexible: `MM:SS.mmm`, `SS.mmm`, or bare `SS`.
- Data is JSON-based, no database needed.

### Running tests

```bash
python -m pytest skate/tests/
```

## Project: `conversational-analytics`

### Purpose

A local, dependency-light prototype proving out a conversational-analytics
architecture (the Microsoft Fabric data-agent pattern, built natively):
a natural-language question about a fictional coffee-shop chain's sales is
grounded in a file-defined semantic model, compiled to DuckDB SQL, executed
against local Parquet, and rendered as a self-contained interactive HTML
dashboard. The LLM (Claude, via the `anthropic` SDK) only ever produces
*structure* — a logical query and Vega-Lite chart encodings — never raw SQL
and never numbers; DuckDB is the sole source of truth for values.

### Structure

```sh
conversational-analytics/
├── semantic_model/       # single source of business meaning: tables, relationships,
│                          # metrics, verified_answers, row_filters — all YAML
├── data/                  # generated Parquet star schema (shipped, runs offline)
├── scripts/generate_data.py
├── fjordroast/
│   ├── semantic/          # loader/validator + query-builder (LogicalQuery -> SQL)
│   ├── agent/              # NL -> LogicalQuery, result -> Vega-Lite spec(s), narrative
│   ├── dashboard/          # Jinja2 HTML assembly + pinned Vega-Lite schema
│   ├── store/              # SQLite "living dashboard" persistence
│   └── server.py           # stretch: FastAPI chat + gallery
├── cli.py                 # ask / validate / refresh / serve
├── tests/
└── dashboards/             # generated dashboard.html files + dashboards.db
```

### State

Complete and functional. `validate` and `refresh` run fully offline against
the shipped data; `ask` and `serve` require `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. See
`conversational-analytics/README.md` for the full architecture writeup and
the Fabric-concept mapping table.

### Running tests

```bash
poetry run python -m pytest conversational-analytics/tests/
```
