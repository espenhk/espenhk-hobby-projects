    Built for issue #29 (the CL/EL/UECL qualifying cascade) and issue #32
    (conditional fixtures): unlike a domestic cup round, not every team
    listed on the competition necessarily enters every round — Norway's
    Champions League runner-up enters at the third qualifying round while
    the champion enters directly at the play-off round, for instance — so
    `entrants` names exactly which of `Competition.teams` play this
    particular round.

    `drop_to_competition`/`drop_to_round` model the cascade: if an entrant
    loses this round, that pair names the round (in a different, lower
    competition) they drop into instead — e.g. a Champions League
    Champions-Path third-qualifying-round loss drops into that season's
    Europa League play-off round. Both are `None` when a loss here has no
    further *qualifying* round to model, either because the real rule sends
    the team straight into a competition's league phase (many matchdays,
    not a single round — out of scope for this project, which only tracks
    qualifying) or because this project simply hasn't sketched that hop yet
    (see `data/competitions/europa_league_2026.yml`'s header for exactly
    which hops are wired and which are left as a documented gap).

    Because the outcome of a round is unknown ahead of time,
    `terminliste/rounds/european_schedule.py` does not pick a branch: it
    walks every reachable round from a team's entry point and blocks the
    union of their windows, so the domestic scheduler stays clear of a
    European commitment regardless of which branch of the cascade actually
    happens. Once a real result is known, resolving the conditional is a
    data edit — delete the round(s) on the branch not taken (or narrow the
    surviving one's window to a `forced_date`) and regenerate; see the
