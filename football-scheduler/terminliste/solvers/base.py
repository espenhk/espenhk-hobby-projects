"""Solver protocol and the shared result type.

Both backends — local search and CP-SAT — consume the same constraint objects
and return the same `SolverResult`, so the report, the CLI and every test are
backend-agnostic. Choosing a solver changes how the schedule is found, never
what a schedule is or how it is judged.
