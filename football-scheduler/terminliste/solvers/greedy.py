"""Constructive first pass: place every fixture on a plausible date, fast.

Greedy and myopic by design. Its job is to hand the local search a complete,
usually-feasible schedule to improve, not to produce a good one — early choices
lock in badly and it cannot see what it costs later.

It scores candidate dates with a cheap local heuristic rather than the full
constraint set. A full evaluation per candidate date would mean roughly 2,500
evaluations of a 372-match schedule just to build the starting point, which is
slower than the entire annealing run that follows. The local heuristic mirrors
the real constraints closely enough to land in the right neighbourhood, and the
real scorer takes over from there.
