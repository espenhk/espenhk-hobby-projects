"""CP-SAT backend — declarative date assignment via OR-Tools.

Enabled with `--solver cpsat`. Requires OR-Tools, which is an optional
dependency; the import is deferred so the default install stays light.

The model assigns *dates* only: who plays whom, and which way round, is fixed
before it is built, by the same round generator the local-search backend uses.
That keeps it to a few thousand booleans and seconds of solve time. Letting
CP-SAT choose the pairings too would make this a genuinely large problem — the
obvious next step, not something quietly assumed away.

So `home_away_breaks`, a property of the pairing order rather than the dates,
is near-constant across this model's solutions and left out of the objective.
The shared scorer still reports it.

Hard constraints carry assumption literals, so an infeasible model names the
rules responsible instead of returning a bare INFEASIBLE.
