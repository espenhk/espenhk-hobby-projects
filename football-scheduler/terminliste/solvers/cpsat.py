"""CP-SAT backend — declarative date assignment via OR-Tools.

Enabled with `--solver cpsat`. Requires OR-Tools, which is an optional
dependency; the import is deferred so the default install stays light.

**What this model does and does not decide.** It assigns *dates*, given the
pairing structure produced by the same round generator the local-search backend
uses. Who plays whom, and which way round, is fixed before the model is built.
That keeps the model to a few thousand booleans and solves in seconds; letting
CP-SAT choose the pairings as well would make it a genuinely large problem and
is the obvious next step rather than something quietly assumed away here.

One consequence worth knowing: `home_away_breaks` is a property of the pairing
order, not the dates, so it is near-constant across this model's solutions and
is left out of the objective. It is still *reported*, by the same scorer both
backends share — the report tells the truth about a schedule regardless of
which solver produced it.

Hard constraints are registered with assumption literals, so an infeasible
model names the rules responsible instead of returning a bare INFEASIBLE.
