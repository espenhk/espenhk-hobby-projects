"""HTTP client for a free, no-signup sports-data API.

Uses TheSportsDB's public test key (`3`) — the same key their own docs
publish for anyone to try the API with, not a secret. It's a small, free
service, not the kind of provider you'd want backing a paying product, but
it covers the Norwegian Eliteserien and Toppserien and needs no account,
which matches this project's "everything runs offline by default, network
access is opt-in" posture: `validate`, `generate` and `score` never call
this; only `cli.py refresh-reference-data` does.

Deliberately a thin wrapper over `urllib.request` rather than a new
`requests`/`httpx` dependency — this is the only place in the project that
makes an HTTP call, and stdlib is enough for one GET-JSON endpoint.
