"""Compare the shipped venue/club data against a live API, without touching it.

This deliberately never writes to `data/*.yml`. A capacity or a coordinate
feeding into the scheduler is worth a human glance before it changes, so the
output here is a diff report — what the API says versus what's on file —
for `cli.py refresh-reference-data` to print. Folding an accepted diff into
the YAML is still a hand edit, same as any other data correction; this tool
only replaces "go search the web for it" with "here's what a structured
source says right now."

Caching (`cache.py`) is what makes that safe to run often: a cold cache or
an unreachable API degrades to "no diffs to show" rather than a crash, so
this can sit in a Makefile target or a periodic check without becoming a
liability the day the API is down — which, inside this project's own
sandboxed dev environment, it always is (the egress proxy only allows a
fixed host allowlist; see README).
