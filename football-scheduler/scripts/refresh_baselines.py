"""Re-score every committed baseline schedule and rewrite its report.

    python scripts/refresh_baselines.py            # rewrite baselines/reports/
    python scripts/refresh_baselines.py --check     # fail if they are stale

Run this after changing anything that could move a baseline's number — a new
constraint, a re-weighted old one, a correction to `data/` — and commit the
diff alongside the change. That diff is the useful artefact: it says, in
points, what the ruleset edit did to a schedule nobody made up.

`--check` is the same run with the writes withheld and a non-zero exit if the
output would have differed. It is what a CI job or a pre-commit hook should
call, and it is what `tests/integration/test_baselines.py` asserts.

Offline and deterministic, like `validate` and `score` — it reads `data/` and
`baselines/sources/` and nothing else.
