# European qualifiers: representation plan (issues #29, #30, #31, #32)

This is the written plan issue #29 asks for, covering all four issues
together — #30, #31 and #32 were opened as the general mechanisms this
project needed in order to model #29's actual use case, and the shipped
implementation treats them as one piece of work rather than four unrelated
ones. Where a section says "implemented", the corresponding code and data
already exist and are tested; "sketched" means the mechanism supports it
but the real 2026-27 data doesn't currently exercise it.

## The problem, restated

Champions League, Europa League and Conference League qualifying interact:
a team eliminated from one competition's qualifying round can drop into a
different competition's equivalent round rather than being out of Europe
entirely. From this project's point of view — scheduling Eliteserien and
Toppserien around commitments it doesn't control — three things make this
harder than the Norwegian Cup, which already had a similar-looking
"forced date or vague window" mechanism (`CupRound`) before this work
started:

1. **Not every entrant plays every round.** A cup's entered teams are all
   assumed to reach the final (opponents are unknown, but survival isn't in
   question for scheduling purposes). A European qualifying round's entrant
   list is different per round — Norway's 2026-27 Champions League
   runner-up enters at the third qualifying round, its champion enters
   directly at the play-off round — so "which teams are in this round" has
   to be a property of the round, not the competition.
2. **Whether a team is even in a given round is genuinely unknown.** A cup
   round's *date* might be vague, but the team's presence in it isn't. A
   European qualifying round's date can be just as vague (real dates are
   published a season ahead as target weeks, then confirmed leg by leg),
   *and* whether the team survived to play it is unknown until the previous
   tie is decided.
3. **A loss doesn't mean "out" — it means "somewhere else."** Losing a
   Champions League qualifying round can mean dropping into the Europa
   League's equivalent round, which itself cascades into the Conference
   League. The domestic scheduler needs to treat the team as still
   potentially committed on those dates regardless of which branch is real,
   until a result narrows it down.

## Representation (issue #29, #30)

`EuropeanRound` (`terminliste/model/schema.py`) is a sibling of `CupRound`,
both sharing a `_ScheduledRound` base that carries the forced-date-XOR-window
mechanics issue #30 asked for generalised: `forced_date` when a date is
confirmed, `window_start`/`window_end` (+ `granularity`) when only the week,
month or quarter is known, and a `forced_date` can always replace a window
later without touching anything downstream — narrowing a vague date is a
data edit, not a re-model. This was already true for cup rounds before this
work; extracting the shared base just means a European round gets the same
guarantee for free.

`EuropeanRound` adds three things `CupRound` doesn't need:

- `entrants: list[str]` — which of the competition's teams actually play
  this specific round, addressing point 1 above.
- `drop_to_competition` / `drop_to_round` — where an entrant lands if
  eliminated *here*, naming a round in a different `Competition`. Both are
  `None` when a loss here has no further qualifying round to track (see
  "Scope boundary: qualifying only" below).

A `Competition` gains `format: "european"` alongside `"league"`/`"cup"`,
and `european_rounds: list[EuropeanRound]` alongside `cup_rounds`. Three
competitions carry this format for 2026-27:
`data/competitions/champions_league_2026.yml`, `europa_league_2026.yml`,
`conference_league_2026.yml` — one per UEFA competition, each declaring
only the rounds that have a live Norwegian entrant.

## Movable vs. fixed (issue #31)

`Competition.movable: bool` is an explicit flag rather than something
inferred from `format`. In the shipped data every `league` competition is
`movable: true` and every `cup`/`european` competition is `movable: false`,
but making it explicit means the data says outright which tournaments this
project schedules and which it only schedules *around* — exactly what issue
#31 asked for as an acceptance criterion, not just a re-statement of
`format`. Mechanically, a movable competition's fixtures are generated and
dated by the solver (`season.competitions`); a non-movable one is resolved
once, up front (`cup_schedule.py` / `european_schedule.py`), and the result
is handed to the solver as a set of dates to schedule around, never as
something either solver backend proposes moving.

## Resolving the cascade (issue #29, #32)

`terminliste/rounds/european_schedule.py` walks a team's cascade from its
entry round rather than trying to predict a result. Two edges leave any
given round for a given team:

- **Win-progression**: the next round in the same competition's
  `european_rounds` list, if the team is listed among that round's
  `entrants` — no cascade pointer needed, since staying in the same
  competition is the default.
- **Elimination**: `drop_to_competition`/`drop_to_round`, if set — a
  cascade into a different, lower competition's round.

Both are followed unconditionally, because which one is real is exactly the
unknown. Every round reachable at the same cascade *depth* (0 = entry
round, 1 = the round after, and so on) is merged into a single
`EuropeanCommitmentWindow` — one blocked date range per depth, spanning the
earliest start and latest end across every branch still open at that depth.

This is a deliberate simplification rather than full branch tracking, and
it works because of a real scheduling fact: UEFA keeps a qualifying
*stage* — Q1, Q2, Q3, play-offs — within the same week or two across all
three competitions, specifically so a team dropping down keeps roughly to
schedule instead of getting an extra rest week for losing. That means the
set of *weeks* a team might be required to play at a given depth is knowable
even before the identity of the actual branch is. A full decision tree
(which round, on which specific date, under which exact result) would be
more precise but wouldn't change what the domestic scheduler actually needs
— a date range to avoid — so the simpler structure is what's built.

`EuropeanCommitmentConflict` (`terminliste/scoring/hard.py`) is the
constraint that acts on the result: it is `CupRoundConflict`'s counterpart,
keeping a team's league matches at least `min_rest_days` clear of every
window in its resolved cascade. It differs from `CupRoundConflict` in being
range-based rather than point-based, since a European commitment is a
window (vague date, or a resolved-but-still-two-legged tie) even once which
competition it belongs to is certain.

**Issue #32's "harder case"** — a conditional fixture whose date, once
triggered, is fixed and non-reschedulable, forcing other movable fixtures
to move — falls out of this without new machinery. Resolving a real result
is a data edit: delete the `EuropeanRound` on the branch not taken (or turn
the surviving one's window into a `forced_date` once UEFA confirms it), and
regenerate. The solver already treats a `forced_date` on a non-movable
competition as a hard constraint to schedule around; a regenerated schedule
reshuffles whatever movable fixture now conflicts, the same way it already
would for a newly-added blackout date or fixed requirement. No mechanism
this project didn't already have is needed for that half of issue #32 — the
work was building the *conditional* half (issue #29's cascade), which this
document is otherwise about.

## Scope boundary: qualifying only

This project tracks UEFA *qualifying* rounds, not the group/league phase
that follows. A team eliminated from a competition's last qualifying round
(or, on some paths, its third qualifying round) doesn't fall out of Europe
under the post-2024 CL/EL/UECL format — it drops straight into the next
competition's *league phase*: many matchdays spread across autumn, not a
single round with a date to avoid. Modelling that would mean tracking a
whole second competition structure (a mini-league, not a knockout cascade)
for a team that might end up in any of three different ones depending on
results neither this project nor its data source can know in advance.
`drop_to_competition`/`drop_to_round` is `None` wherever the real rule sends
a losing team into a league phase rather than another qualifying round —
this is a deliberate boundary, not an oversight, and is called out in each
data file's header at the specific round it applies to.

## What's fully implemented vs. sketched, for 2026-27

- **Champions League — fully implemented.** Both Norwegian entrants
  (Bodø/Glimt at the third qualifying round, Viking at the play-off round)
  are modelled with real dates. Neither round sets `drop_to_*`: League Path
  Q3 losses and play-off losses on either path both go to the Europa
  League league phase directly, which is the scope boundary above, not a
  gap.
- **Europa League — Conference League cascade — implemented, real data.**
  Europa League's third-qualifying-round entry (`q3`) sets
  `drop_to_competition: conference_league_2026`, `drop_to_round: playoff` —
  the one real, sourced UEFA rule ("third-qualifying-round losers enter the
  Conference League play-off round") that lands on another qualifying round
  rather than a league phase, so it's the hop this project actually wires
  between two competitions on live data rather than leaving as a documented
  gap.
- **Conference League — sketched.** Brann's own progression through the
  competition (Q2 -> Q3 -> play-off) is modelled with real dates, including
  receiving Europa League's cascade at the play-off round. What isn't
  wired: the Conference League's own play-off round has no `drop_to_*`
  (its losers enter the Conference League league phase itself, the same
  scope boundary as everywhere else), and this project doesn't model
  Conference League Q1 (no Norwegian entrant this cycle, so it's omitted
  rather than added as an inert empty round).
- **Mechanism generality — proven by tests, not just by the real data.**
  `tests/test_european_schedule.py` exercises multi-hop cascades, branch
  merging at a shared depth, and the error paths on synthetic data, so the
  code path is verified independent of whether the current season's real
  UEFA rules happen to exercise every hop.
